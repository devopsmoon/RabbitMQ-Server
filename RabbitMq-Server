RabbitMQ Installation
RabbitMQ is a messaging Queue which is used by some components of the applications.
Manual Installation
Erlang is a dependency which is needed for RabbitMQ.
yum install https://packages.erlang-solutions.com/erlang/rpm/centos/7/x86_64/esl-erlang_22.2.1-1~centos~7_amd64.rpm -y 
Setup YUM repositories for RabbitMQ.
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
Install RabbitMQ
yum install rabbitmq-server -y 
Start RabbitMQ
systemctl enable rabbitmq-server 
systemctl start rabbitmq-server 
RabbitMQ comes with a default username / password as guest/guest. But this user cannot be used to connect. Hence we need to create one user for the application.
Create application user
rabbitmqctl add_user roboshop roboshop123
rabbitmqctl set_user_tags roboshop administrator
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / roboshop ".*" ".*" ".*"
